        Saarni Music was founded by Markus Heinonen, a musician since 1999 and a passionate recording engineer since 2004. Markus has always been dedicated to the art of music production and the joy it brings to people's lives. His mission was to create a studio that could harness the latest technological advancements in the industry to make the production process more efficient, while still maintaining a human touch and a commitment to quality.
<br>At the beginning of 2016 Markus had aquired the education, insight, location and the community to start the journey as an entrepreneur. He had worked with numerous recording studios, live clubs, record labels and realised that the resources available to aspiring musicians are mostly business oriented, where as the optimal studio and creative space for everyone would be more focused on creative endeavours.
<br>With this vision in mind, Saarni Music was born in 2016. Since then, the studio has expanded to offer a wide range of services, including recording, producing, mixing, mastering, and even rental space for live shows, music videos, and photoshoots. Our team is dedicated to bringing out the best in every artist and helping them achieve their musical dreams.
<br>We understand that recording and producing music can be a complex and daunting process. That's why we offer expert consultation and teaching services to help guide you through every step of the way. Whether you're a seasoned musician or a complete beginner, we're here to help you realize your musical potential.
<br>In short, Saarni Music is more than just a recording studio. We're a community of passionate music lovers who are dedicated to bringing amazing art to life. Come and join us on this musical journey!

            <p><span>Recording</span> <br>Recording is the process of capturing audio material in physical and digital form and saving them as tracks into the recording software.</p>
            <p>"Recording is a wild process consisting of multiple variables that affect the final outcome. These include, but not limited to: Time available, Gear that is used,  Genre connotations that apply, Energy levels of everyone involved, What kind of end result we are going for, etc... Instead of it being just about pressing a button, it's about capturing the essence of the music, the emotion, and the vibe of the moment. Our engineer Markus has the understanding to deal with everything that is going on, armed with Saarni Studio, a well equipped facility for the most pristine sound quality possible. We will work with you every step of the way to ensure that your recording is nothing short of spectacular"</p>

            <p>"The process of music production involves every detail that goes into making a record, outside of the technical aspects of recording and mixing, working towards the end result. Producing can begin before recording or even before songwriting, going all the way to the mastering phase. It can involve, but not limited to: Writing music or lyrics, arrangement, personal guidance, sound design, etc..."</p>

            <p><span>Mixing</span> <br>Mixing is where everything comes together. All the recorded elements become a part of one cohesive whole entity of sound.</p>
            <p>"Mixing is the part that makes or breaks the record. In order to become classics, great performances and amazing songs require a mix that not only sound great but feel great as well. Saarni Studio mix engineer Markus has done hundreds of mixes since 2004 and aim to evolve every time a little bit. We are very aware of the popular trend of independent artists recording with a very low budgets and we are perfectly capable of dealing with those recordings and mix them into a presentable form."</p>
